Loan Approval Classifier â€“ Machine Learning Desktop Application using Python and Tkinter
This project is a machine learning-based desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter. It is specifically designed to predict loan approval using a Decision Tree Classifier. Users can train the model on a preloaded dataset, evaluate its performance, visualize the decision tree, and make predictions for new applicants â€” all through a user-friendly graphical interface.

Purpose of the Project
The application helps users understand the process of decision tree classification in a real-world context â€” loan approval. A decision tree is an intuitive, tree-structured machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It splits data into branches based on feature values, making it ideal for transparent decision-making.

Technologies and Libraries Used :
Python â€“ Core programming language.

Tkinter â€“ For building the GUI.

Pandas â€“ To manage and preprocess the dataset.

NumPy â€“ For numerical computations.

Scikit-learn (sklearn) â€“ To train the Decision Tree model and evaluate it.

Matplotlib â€“ For tree visualization.

Features of the Application
ðŸ”¹ Preloaded Dataset
The app loads a dataset (loan_approval_data.csv) containing loan applicant details and their approval status. The target column (Approved) is used to train the classification model.

ðŸ”¹ Adjustable Test Size
A slider allows users to select the proportion of data used for testing (from 10% to 50%).

ðŸ”¹ Model Training
Clicking the Train Model button splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the DecisionTreeClassifier, and displays:

Accuracy

Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

ðŸ”¹ Visualize and Export Decision Tree
Users can visualize the trained decision tree structure and export it as a .png image using the Export Tree button.

ðŸ”¹ Predict New Records
Users can enter new applicant details (e.g., Age, Income, Employment, Credit Score, Loan Amount) in a pop-up form. The trained model then predicts if the loan should be approved or not.

Advantages and Use Cases
Requires no programming knowledge.

Ideal for educational purposes, demos, or small-scale loan prediction tasks.

Helps users visualize how decision trees make decisions.

Can be extended for other classification tasks.

Conclusion: 
The Loan Approval Classifier is an accessible, visual, and interactive way to apply machine learning using decision trees. It integrates model training, evaluation, visualization, and prediction in one cohesive GUI â€” perfect for learners, educators, and anyone curious about machine learning in practical scenarios.
